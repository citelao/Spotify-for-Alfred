So, you've heard of **Spotifious**, eh? How it lets you *play your perfect picks quick*? Search Spotify, control your music, generally rock?

It's built off a lot of other people's work— [PHPFunk](https://github.com/phpfunk/alfred-spotify-controls) and [David Ferguson](http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com/) especially— and tries to match the functionality of Alfred's integrated iTunes player. It's not done, but it's getting there. And I think it's pretty cool.

## Download & Install ##

Current version: v0.61

1. [Download](https://github.com/citelao/Spotify-for-Alfred/archive/master.zip) this repository.
2. Open `spotifious.alfredworkflow` by double-clicking it or dragging it into Alfred.
3. Continue on with your merry day.

## How to Use ##

So let's assume you've downloaded and installed the workflow. Now what?

1. Press ^⌘Enter

Good! You should briefly see a loading entry, then the main menu

You can action the song title (press `enter`) to play or pause the song, action the album or artist to search for that album or artist, or just start typing to search for cool music.

**Note:** Give it a moment when you search; it uses Spotify's slow API.
